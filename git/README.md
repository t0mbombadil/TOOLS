## Github - 2FA working with git push & not exposing email (private mail option)

### After setting up 2FA on github generate access token and use it for git
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token

Reset current credentials on git (otheriwse your push will be rejected)
```
git config --system --unset credential.helper
```
Now in place of password use your generated token

### Configure git for private mail (after checking it on Github account)
src - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43863522/error-your-push-would-publish-a-private-email-address

When enabling the “Block command line pushes that expose my email” feature, you’ll also want to configure Git to use your no-reply email address. Don’t worry—this won’t affect your contribution graph. All commits will still be associated with your account.

- Open Terminal.
- Change the current working directory to the local repository where you want to configure the email address that you associate with your Git commits.
- Find your GitHub noreply address in your GitHub's Personal Settings → Emails. It's mentioned in the description of the Keep my email address private checkbox. Usually, it starts with a unique identifier, plus your username.
- Set an email address in Git. Use your GitHub-provided no-reply email address.

-- Setting your email address for every repository on your computer

```
git config --global user.email "{ID}+{username}@users.noreply.github.com"
```
-- Setting your email address for a single repository

```
git config user.email "{ID}+{username}@users.noreply.github.com"
```
- Reset the author information on your last commit:
```
git commit --amend --reset-author
```
-- If you have multiple commits with your private e-mail address, see this answer.

- Now you can push the commit with the noreply e-mail address, and future commits will have the noreply e-mail address as well.
```
git push
```

Once you configure Git, commits will use your alternate “noreply” email address, and any pushes that don’t will be rejected
