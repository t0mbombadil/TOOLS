## 

```bash
brew install aircrack-ng
```
This brew installation would miss linux-only airmon-ng - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45314589/airmon-ng-not-working-in-terminal-command-not-found?rq=1
But you could use `airport` command for this. You could see networks with:

```bash
sudo airport -s
```
